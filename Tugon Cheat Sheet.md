**How can we assure na ikaw yung karapat dapat?**
- I take my responsibilities seriously and will always follow through on my commitments. You can count on me to be reliable and to deliver on what I have promised.
- I'm also inclined that I'm following the constitutions prior to the position that im currently running up for, kaya alam ko kung ano ang tinatakbo ko, kasi kaya ko tugunan ang mga hinanaing ng mga problema ng ating mga studyante, kasi hindi ko naman pinili etong position na to' kung di ko kaya naman kaya, kaya  iisama ko kayo sa aking paglakbay sa konseho na para isolusyonan eto.

**If elected, what do you as a leader bring to this position that will help to promote growth in the students around you?**
- If elected, I would be sure to use the skills that I developed as a candidate running for the presidency. I wish to demonstrate transparency to the students here at our UE. I believe that with transparency, I can give the EN Warriors the ability to share their true concerns with me and allow them the opportunity to personally flourish while they work on fixing what they believe needs to be improved

**How will you increase the awareness of the significance of your position to a wide range of students?**
- As a candidate who is running and fighting for the position of being the next president for the ENSC, I would make sure to openly discuss my position with students whom I encounter. I would also ensure to be present at as many on-campus events as possible, discussing my position and views with other student organizations, and being socially active to create opportunities for them, and vocalizing them on our social media platforms. Lastly, I would ensure that our students' voices are represented

**What if ikaw lang yung manalo?**

**One word that could represent a slate running for a student council for us is "VISIONARY."**

Each member of our team brings unique skills and experiences to the table that will enable us to address the diverse needs of our student body. We have a clear vision for the future of our school and a comprehensive platform that outlines our plans to improve the academic, social, and extracurricular experiences of our students.

**What can you say to our president of the Philippines, if i have the chance to ever met them in person?**
- As someone eyeing the position of the next president, I hope that our country can continue to work towards a brighter future for all Filipinos. I call on the President of the Philippines to prioritize the needs of the youth and to invest in education and skills development programs that will empower us to contribute effectively to the growth and development of our nation.

- We need leaders who understand the importance of education and who are willing to invest in our future by providing opportunities for us to learn and develop our skills. We need access to quality education, training, and apprenticeship programs that will prepare us for the challenges of the future job market.

- As student leaders, we are committed to working alongside the government in building a better future for our country. We believe that by working together, we can create a brighter, more prosperous future for all Filipinos
